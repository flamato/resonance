    "# 2. Introducing Mechanical Vibrations By Investigating a Book Oscillating on a Cylindrical Cup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces a single degree of freedom vibratory system of a textbook balancing on a cylindrical coffee cup. The system is implemented as a model that students can interact with in order to visualize its free response and compare the computer simulation to a demonstration in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After the completion of this assignment students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   load a specific system\n",
    "-   view and set parameters (constants, coordinates) on a system\n",
    "-   create a visualization that depicts the system's configuration\n",
    "-   compute the system's free response\n",
    "-   visualize the change in configuration wit respect to the free response\n",
    "-   interactively adjust the book shape to see the affect on system response\n",
    "-   understand the concept of natural frequency and its relationship to mass/inertia\n",
    "-   estimate the period of a sinusoidal vibration from a time series\n",
    "-   compare a computer simulation result to experimental result\n",

    "Here we will study a simple vibratory system. A vibrating mechanical system is typically defined as a collection of rigid and flexible objects that interact in a closed envelope. If you set a cylindrical cup on its side and place a book lying flat on top of it, the book will oscillate if initially displaced at a small non-horizontal angle. Note that it oscillates about a horizontal position. This position is called an *equilibrium point*, *equilibrium state*, or *equilibrium configuration* which is a natural position the system comes to when there is no motion. Vibration is formally defined as an *oscillation about an equilibrium*. The video below shows the real system in action:"

    "All systems will have different sets of constants. There is no unique way to define the constants either. For example, we could have chosen area and one linear dimension instead of three linear dimensions. This system could also have more constants, for example what if you were on the moon? Maybe the acceleration due to gravity should be an explicit constant. Or what if the book to cup connection was very slippery? Maybe the coefficient of friction would be a specific constant. It is important to note that the system constants, as we've defined here, are all constant with respect to time.\n",

    "There are are an infinite number of time varying parameters, but it is often preferable to choose a uniquely simple set of time varying parameters, often called *generalized coordinates*. These coordinates define the **configuration** of the system. In our case, the vertical and horizontal location of the book's mass center could uniquely describe the configuration of the system (if the book can't slip on the cup).

The degrees of freedom are the number of independent parameters that define the configuration. The non-slipping book on a cup has 1 degree of freedom which is described by the single generalized coordinate, the book's angle. The system's generalized coordinates can be accessed as such:"

For example, maybe you are interested in the vertical and horizontal location of the book's lower left corner. If you had an appropriate dynamics distance sensor you could measure this location as it changes with time. Or you can define how these two measurement parameters are a function of the book angle and the system's geometry. You can add measurement parameters to a system by defining Python functions that compute the geometric relationship. Given the value of a generalized coordinate and the values of the system's constant parameters, we can define a function that computes the measurement parameter. These functions need to be to accept scalars and arrays, so import NumPy as a shorthand variable `np` to make use of array aware functions like `np.cos()` and `np.sin()` :"
