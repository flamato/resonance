    "As an example we will study a model of washing machine vibrating. A washing machine typically has a structure that sits on the ground, usually on padded feet that provide some damping and then there is a drum that spins relative to the machine's main housing structure. Inside the drum, clothes can end up clumped in ways that cause the mass center of the contents of the drum to lie somewhere other than the spin axis. See this video for an example of what can happen:"
